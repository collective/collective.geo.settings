0.2 (2009-10-19)
----------------

* Allowed container-specific geo settings to be specified through an
  appropriate form and recorded via an annotation on the Folder/Collection.
  Users can select the same options as available in the control panel
  (zoom, Google Maps, focus point) now on a per-container basis.

* Updated coordinate references to be consistent with WGS 1984 
  reference system.  This involves standardising the coordinate order 
  to be [longitude, latitude] rather than [latitude, longitude].
  [rockdj]
* Fixed the Google Maps url that is being returned and rendered, producing
  an incorrect API key message each time Google Maps is loaded.
